    <!-- There are 3 ways to include CSS in our page
        *External CSS - the CSS styles are in a seperate .CSS file - best practice
         Embeded CSS -  the CSS styles apply to just 1 page - <style> </style> ; okay to use sparingly
         *Inline CSS - set styles on a particular HTML element - very time consuming to update; try to avoid -->
